I am an assistant professor of law at the [University of Nebraska College of Law](https://law.unl.edu/james-f-tierney/). My research focuses on regulation and enforcement in retail securities markets, behavioral finance, contract design, and political economy. Before joining the Nebraska faculty, I was senior counsel at the SEC's Office of the General Counsel and practiced appellate litigation at Mayer Brown LLP.

My recent work examines "gamification" in stock trading apps and the regulatory challenges posed by digital engagement practices in securities markets. I have been quoted in the *Financial Times*, *Barron's*, *CNN Business*, *Business Insider*, and *Mother Jones*, and have published in the *Duke Law Journal* and the *Yale Law Journal Forum*.
