  description = "I serve as Senior Counsel within the Adjudication Group of the Office of the General Counsel. In this role, I act as counsel to the Commission with respect to contested appeals from decisions of administrative law judges, self-regulatory organizations, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and with respect to administrative proceedings set for a hearing before the Commission itself. I advise the Commission on the resolution of the issues raised in these matters; review the evidence and briefs, and conduct legal research; draft orders in response to the parties' motions; and draft opinions of the Commission as final agency action in these matters. I also communicate with stakeholders around the Commission's staff, and with the Commission in these matters through action and pre-argument memoranda and at closed Commission meetings."

  While at Mayer Brown, I litigated appeals and critical motions on behalf of businesses, industry groups, and individuals. My practice focused on writing briefs and motions; I was the principal or contributing author of seventeen filings before the U.S. Supreme Court and appellate courts, and dozens of other critical motions in district courts. This experience spanned a range of substantive areas—including the capital markets, financial services, and telecommunications sectors—in complex litigation and putative class actions. My representative engagements included: 

-	Persuading the Second Circuit to exempt residential mortgage-backed securities from the Trust Indenture Act.

-	In several cases, defending financial institutions against claims brought by SEC and CFTC relief defendants to recover alleged damages arising out of third parties' securities frauds.

-	Co-authoring petitioner's merits briefs before the Supreme Court in Hana Financial v. Hana Bank (2015).

-	Arguing before two federal appellate courts on behalf of detained and incarcerated individuals. 

-	Drafting merits-stage amicus briefs before the Supreme Court in religious accommodation and affirmative action cases.

In addition to representing clients after disputes arise, I counseled clients in navigating complex regulatory and policy challenges. This involved evaluating proposed legislation and agency action and assisting key decisionmakers in understanding these actions. I prepared hearing testimony and answers to questions for the record about private securities litigation and consumer class action reform. In addition, I drafted six significant agency comment letters and a dozen white papers and briefers addressing varied topics such as securities class action litigation, rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and consumer arbitration agreements. I also advised clients on options for challenging laws and regulations in federal court."""
