I am an assistant professor of law at the University of Nebraska College of Law. I teach core and advanced classes in business law, including business associations, securities regulation, and corporate finance. My research focuses on regulation and enforcement with respect to intermediaries in retail securities markets; corporate finance and governance; contract design and the analysis of textual data; behavioral economics of financial markets regulation; and political economy.

Before joining the Nebraska faculty, I was senior counsel at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of the General Counsel, in which role I advised the SEC on administrative proceedings involving all aspects of the federal securities laws. Before joining the SEC’s staff in 2015, I practiced regulatory policy and Supreme Court and appellate litigation at Mayer Brown LLP for three years, and clerked for Judge Mary Schroeder of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
