I am associate dean of academic affairs and associate professor of law (with tenure) at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology. I teach core and advanced classes in business and regulatory law, including business organizations, corporate finance, legislation, and administrative law. My research focuses on securities law (trading, markets, and retail financial advice); administrative law (adjudication, rulemaking, and self-regulation); and legal analytics and law-as-data empirical analysis.

Before entering the academy, I was senior counsel at the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of the General Counsel, in which role I advised the SEC on administrative proceedings involving all aspects of the federal securities laws. Before joining the SEC's staff in 2015, I practiced regulatory policy and Supreme Court and appellate litigation at Mayer Brown LLP for three years, and clerked for Judge Mary Schroeder of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Previously, I was an assistant professor of law at the University of Nebraska College of Law (2020--2023).
