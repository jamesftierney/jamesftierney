title: "Comment letter on SECâ€™s request for information on digital engagement practices, File No. S7-10-21"

I submitted these comments in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions' request for information on "digital engagement practices," sometimes referred to as "gamification" in stock trading apps. This comment letter draws on and briefly summarizes for regulators two of my other accepted and working papers posted here on SSRN. Think of it as an executive summary of the papers, which I submitted as attachments.

The letter focuses on three themes: how we got here; why digital engagement practices might be a subject of concern for securities law; and categories of regulatory responses and interventions that the SEC might consider adopting in any future rulemaking on digital engagement practices.

The comment letter can be [found on SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3934893).
