summary: "Presenting my job talk paper on how firms design consumer contracts' to alter policymakers' preferences for status quo contract rules by appealing to behavioral law and economics."
abstract: "This article identifies and explains an overlooked puzzle about consumer contracts. Consumers ignore most contract terms when clicking yes to accept, so scholars usually expect companies to pick ignored terms of the lowest possible quality that courts will let them get away with. One such term might require you to arbitrate instead of participating in a class action. But some companies pick terms that are surprisingly high quality: agreeing to subsidize arbitration costs, or paying you and your attorney if you win more than its last settlement offer. Courts donâ€™t require these terms that consumers ignore, so firms that pick them firms incur costs for unexplained reasons.
I identify a novel function of these terms: their audience is not courts or consumers, but policymakers deciding whether to prohibit other contract terms that are more important to companies. Drawing on behavioral law and economics, and illustrating with a case study, this article shows how companies use high-quality terms to frame the status quo rule. High-quality terms help show how the status quo rule might benefit hypothetical consumers (who never actually use these terms), letting companies appeal to policymakers' cognitive biases so they perceive status quo rules as better than they actually are. This has important theoretical and practical implications. Because contracts' framing effects put a thumb on the scale against reform, reformers should take them into account. And we might reconsider claims in policy debates about how society benefits from what status quo rules let companies do."
